\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a real-time deal discovery system that leverages big data technologies to provide personalized product discount recommendations. The system processes e-commerce data streams to identify and recommend relevant deals to users based on their preferences and browsing patterns. Using a microservices architecture deployed via Docker, the system implements Kafka for stream processing, Spark for data analysis, and Cassandra for caching. Experimental results demonstrate the system's ability to process data streams efficiently while maintaining sub-200ms latency for recommendations.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid expansion of e-commerce has transformed the way consumers discover, compare, and purchase products online. Modern e-commerce platforms generate massive volumes of data every second, encompassing user interactions, product searches, price fluctuations, inventory updates, and promotional campaigns. This data deluge presents both an opportunity and a challenge: while it enables platforms to offer dynamic pricing and personalized experiences, it also makes it increasingly difficult for users to efficiently identify the best deals relevant to their interests.

Despite the prevalence of discounts and special offers, users often face information overload, sifting through countless listings and advertisements to find genuine bargains. Traditional search and filter mechanisms are frequently inadequate, as they may not account for real-time price changes, flash sales, or personalized preferences. As a result, users may miss out on significant savings or spend excessive time searching for deals.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a real-time deal discovery system that leverages big data technologies to aggregate, process, and analyze e-commerce data streams. By continuously monitoring product listings and user behavior, the system identifies and recommends the most relevant and valuable deals to each user. The architecture integrates scalable components such as Apache Kafka for data ingestion, Apache Spark for stream processing, and Cassandra for low-latency data storage, all orchestrated within Docker containers for ease of deployment and scalability.

This approach not only enhances the user experience by surfacing timely and personalized deals but also demonstrates the potential of big data frameworks in solving complex, real-world problems in the e-commerce domain. The remainder of this paper details the system's design, data processing pipeline, risk management strategies, and experimental results, providing a comprehensive blueprint for real-time, data-driven deal recommendation platforms.

\section{System Architecture}

\section{Methodology}
The data preprocessing pipeline is designed to ensure high-quality, reliable input for real-time analytics in the deal recommendation system. Given the high-velocity nature of e-commerce data streams, preprocessing is performed using a distributed streaming approach to ensure both timeliness and robustness.
\section{Data Preprocessing}

The data preprocessing pipeline is designed to ensure high-quality, reliable input for real-time analytics in the deal recommendation system. Given the high-velocity nature of e-commerce data streams, preprocessing is performed using a distributed streaming approach to ensure both timeliness and robustness.

\subsection{A. Stream Processing with Spark Structured Streaming}

Product and pricing data were collected via web scraping from major Egyptian e-commerce platforms such as Jumia, Noon, B.TECH, and 2B. These platforms provided diverse product categories and discount patterns that formed the basis of the recommendation dataset. which are then ingested in real time using Apache Kafka and processed with Apache Spark Structured Streaming. Key preprocessing steps in this layer include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Schema Enforcement and Parsing:} JSON payloads from Kafka are parsed using a predefined schema that ensures type consistency for fields like \texttt{deal\_id}, \texttt{user\_id}, \texttt{item}, \texttt{price}, and \texttt{discount}.
    
    \item \textbf{Timestamp Normalization:} Event timestamps are explicitly cast to \texttt{TimestampType}. Missing or malformed timestamps are automatically replaced with the current system time to maintain temporal continuity.
    
    \item \textbf{Error Handling:} The pipeline leverages Spark's \texttt{foreachBatch} mechanism for per-batch error handling. This isolates failures at the batch level and prevents full pipeline disruption.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Cleaning:} Malformed or null fields are filtered or imputed to ensure downstream compatibility and quality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{B. Real-Time Ingestion and Storage}

Processed records are written directly to Apache Cassandra using the Spark-Cassandra connector. The records are appended to a keyspace named \texttt{deals\_keyspace}, with dedicated tables for raw deals and recommended deals. Indices on user IDs are created to support efficient real-time lookups.

\subsection{C. Real-Time Scoring and Feature Computation}

Preprocessed features are used in conjunction with deployed machine learning models to score incoming deals in real time. Spark DataFrames allow for scalable, in-memory transformations, while Cassandra serves as the backend for low-latency feature retrieval and caching.

\subsection{D. Integration and Scalability}

The preprocessing pipeline is fully containerized using Docker and orchestrated to scale horizontally. By combining Kafka, Spark Structured Streaming, and Cassandra, the system ensures real-time performance with fault tolerance and scalability—enabling responsive and personalized deal recommendations.
\section{Risk Analysis}
\subsection{A. Risk Assessment Framework}

Effective risk management is critical to ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of the real-time deal discovery system. Given the distributed nature of the architecture and the reliance on real-time data pipelines, potential points of failure must be proactively identified and addressed.

Risks may arise from various sources, including system dependencies (e.g., Kafka, Spark, Cassandra), infrastructure limitations, data inconsistencies, or operational oversights. The assessment framework considers both the likelihood and impact of each risk, along with mitigation strategies that ensure service continuity and data integrity.

Table~\ref{tab:risks} summarizes the major risks identified during system design and deployment, along with their corresponding mitigation approaches.
