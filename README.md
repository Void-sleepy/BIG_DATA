# BIG_DATA
This Project presents a real-time deal discovery sys-
tem that leverages big data technologies to provide personalized
product discount recommendations. The system processes e-
commerce data streams to identify and recommend relevant deals
to users based on their preferences and browsing patterns. Using
a microservices architecture deployed via Docker, the system
implements Kafka for stream processing, Spark for data analysis,
and Cassandra for caching. Experimental results demonstrate
the system’s ability to process data streams efficiently while
maintaining sub-200ms latency for recommendations.
